## FAQ
- Why is my antivirus blocking Agent Picker?
> the executable(.exe) version was compiled in a way that your antivirus doesn't like(?), but yes it is safe, you can review the source code and compile it yourself, you will get the same result.

- What is this *"extra protection"* ? and why?
> The extra protection basically makes the anticheat(Vanguard) not know that the Agent Picker is an AHK.
This is a prevention if at some point Vanguard starts to realize that players who pick agents too quickly have AHK open in the background.
